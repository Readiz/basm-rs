========

The ELF parsing and relocation routines in basm-rs were adapted
from the following implementation of MINT64OS, licensed under GPLv2+:
    https://github.com/kkamagui/mint64os/blob/master/02.Kernel64/Source/Loader.c

The original license statement:
    /**
     *  file    ApplicationLoader.c
     *  date    2009/12/26
     *  author  kkamagui
     *          Copyright(c)2008 All rights reserved by kkamagui
     *  brief   응용프로그램을 로드하여 실행하는 로더(Loader)에 관련된 함수를 정의한 소스 파일
     */
(brief in English:
    source file defining functions for loader that loads and runs applications)

Unlike all other parts of basm-rs, which are under the MIT license,
the files implementing ELF parsing and relocation are exceptionally
licensed under GPLv2+ since it is derived from an existing GPLv2+
implementation, "Loader.c" (see above). Although GPLv2+ mandates
licensing the project in its entirety as GPLv2+, the original author
has kindly granted us permission to confine the GPLv2+ license to
the parts explicitly derived from "Loader.c".

There are currently three files licensed under GPLv2+:
    scripts/static-pie-elf2bin.py
    basm-std/src/platform/loader/amd64_elf.rs
    basm-std/src/platform/loader/i686_elf.rs     (current file)
